Logswan 2.1.12 (2021-12-02)

- Fix a use-after-free (read) triggered by strcmp(3) calls.

  The parse_request() function didn't zero out the parsed_request struct
  between each call. Since the parsing loop was switched to using getline(3)
  instead of a fixed size buffer to process log lines, it could reference
  already freed memory in certain cases.

  Thanks to Brian Carpenter (@geeknik) for finding and reporting the issue.
