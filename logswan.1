.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a fast Web log analyzer using probabilistic data structures.
It is targeted at very large log files, typically APIs logs.
It has constant memory usage regardless of the log file size, and takes
approximatively 4MB of RAM.
.Pp
Unique visitors counting is performed using two HyperLogLog counters (one for
IPv4, and another one for IPv6), providing a relative accuracy of 0.10%.
.Pp
If
.Ar file
is a single dash (`-'),
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar db
Specify path to a GeoIP database.
.It Fl g
Enable GeoIP lookups.
.It Fl h
Display usage.
.It Fl v
Display version.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following script can be used to process all log files in the current
directory and save the output in a file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh
for file in $(ls *.log)
do
	logswan $file > $file.json
done
exit 0
